# Among (R)Us

> **Attention**  
> This is **not** a finished product at all. I've published the project to show my progress on the implementation and for *(maybe)* collecting some useful feedback and improvement suggestions, so I get better into Rust.  
> If you are looking for a working implementation of the Among Us server, take a look into the [Inpostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor) project.

`among-rus` *(stylized `Among (R)Us`)* is a little side project of mine to get deeper into the Rust language and eco system. The goal of the project is to re-implement a server application for the game [Among Us](https://innersloth.com/gameAmongUs.php) by [InnerSloth](https://innersloth.com).

The project is based on the [writeup of the network protocol](https://github.com/codyphobe/among-us-protocol) of the game by [clodyphobe](https://github.com/codyphobe).

The code is based on the [async-rs](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std) crate for the UDP networking implementation. To be honest, I have no idea if I am using it the right way, but well, I thought maybe it is better to base the networking on an asynchronous base instead of going synchronous from ground up and later refactoring everything for better async performance.

## Trying Yourself

If you want to try the current state of the project, just clone the source via git or download it via GitHub.

To set your local server as server in Among Us, you can use the Client tool of Impostor. [**Read here**](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor#client) on how to set it up.
